This is the code for a project that I did for a class in college, and carried on with after the class ended.  

The stack is as follows:
* Vue.js (front end)
* Node.js (back end)
* MongoDB (database)

The website's name was Autafi, and it was an idea that I had while working on my truck.  I thought it would be great if buyers could put bounties on certain parts that they were looking for, potentially saving sellers of certain parts time and hassle when it came to selling parts.  Parts could also be sold on the website as well. Before I took the website down, everything functioned as intended, and I was working on security measures for the website.  

Users could make an account, which were managed natively and the account information was stored in a MongoDB.  For the purposes of security, the passwords were hashed.  Once logged in, users could make posts relating to the cars or parts they wanted to buy or sell.  An email was a part of each post, and the idea was that interested parties could contact the buying/selling party via email.  There were plans in the works to implement chat rooms so people could communitate within the website, but I did not get around to implementing that functionality.

After I graduated college, I had a bit less free time, and my interest shifted to app development (Android/iOS).  As a result, I decided to take the website down since I did not have the time to aquire users or to further improve the website.
